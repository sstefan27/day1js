        Merlin, the Cornell Lab's popular bird ID app, has spawned a new tool called Merlin Bird Photo ID, and you can help test it out! Just upload a photo, click on the bird's bill, eye, and tail, and let computer vision help you ID the bird. It currently recognizes 400 common North American bird species.
